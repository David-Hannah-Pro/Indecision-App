Indecision App

-from Andrew Mead's REACT course on UDEMY-

Help needed: I tried to add normalize.css library to the project. After hours of errors, I decided to not include it in my project. 
I have deleted it from the project, but now I have a gap between my main div and the html element. This is a big issue since I will have multiple background colors in this project.

Any help is greatly appreciated!
